# Transport Network Design

## Overview
This project is part of the **Transport Network Design** course offered by the International School of Management and Technology in partnership with the University of Sunderland. The goal is to design, implement, and document a scalable, secure, and redundant network for the new branch of London College in Palpa.

## Tasks Undertaken

### Scenario Analysis
- Analyzed the requirements for setting up IT infrastructure for London College's new branch.
- Identified core design goals, including redundancy, scalability, and network monitoring.

### Network Design
- Planned and designed the network topology.
- Created IP addressing tables for WAN connections, ISP and public IPs, and the Palpa branch.

### Basic Configuration
- Configured IP addressing on network devices.
- Implemented multi-layer switching on Layer 3 switches.
- Set up VLAN and inter-VLAN routing using Switch Virtual Interfaces (SVIs).
- Configured DHCP for automated IP assignment.

### Redundancy Implementation
- Configured Layer 2 and Layer 3 redundancy protocols:
  - Enabled Rapid PVST mode for spanning tree.
  - Configured Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) and EtherChannel.
  - Implemented Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) for gateway redundancy.

### WAN Protocols
- Configured Frame Relay for WAN connectivity.

### Network Monitoring
- Deployed network monitoring tools, including:
  - Network Time Protocol (NTP) and Syslog.
  - Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

### VPN Implementation
- Configured a secure VPN for remote access.
- Demonstrated practical usage of VPN for secure communication.

### Troubleshooting
- Documented troubleshooting methods for network issues.
- Provided step-by-step procedures for identifying and resolving common network problems.
